This branch is a proof of concept for bringing devicetree support
into the ar71xx target.

Currently, only the SoC AR9331 is supported!

This is tested on
	TP-Link WR740N-v4
	TP-Link WR741ND-v4
	TP-Link MR3020-v1

Working:
	Clocks
	SPI Flash
	Serial
	eth0/1 + switch
	wifi
	USB
	LEDs
	Buttons
	wifi calibration + MAC addresses come from flash
	watchdog behaves strange, therefore currently disabled

Especially the clock stuff is based on work from Antony Pavlov:

Other parts are taken from lantiq and ramips target

Again, only the AR9331 is targeted, and some things are hardcoded for this
chip; code needs to be rewritten for a more open approach.
